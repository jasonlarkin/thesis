Two frequency-domain methods for predicting phonon frequencies and lifetimes
using the phonon spectral energy density are described. Both methods draw
input from molecular dynamics simulations and lattice dynamics calculations,
but differ in the form of the phonon spectral energy density.
One phonon spectral energy density expression (referred to as $\Phi$) can be
formally derived from lattice dynamics theory. A similar approach in the
time domain has been validated [Turney et al. \emph{Phys. Rev. B} \textbf{79}, 224305
(2009)]. The other phonon spectral energy density expression (referred to as
$\Phi'$) has been proposed [Thomas et al., \emph{Phys. Rev. B} \textbf{81}, 081411(R) (2010)]
but not validated. The expressions for $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ are presented and then
applied to predict the phonon properties and thermal conductivities of three
systems: Lennard-Jones argon, Stillinger-Weber silicon, and a carbon
nanotube modeled using the Reactive Empirical Bond Order potential. $\Phi'$ does not capture the total
phonon spectral energy density predicted by $\Phi$ and therefore cannot
correctly predict the phonon lifetimes or thermal conductivity. Its use in
future work is discouraged and we reccomend the use of $\Phi$.

\section{\label{Section_Introduction}Introduction}

Phonons are the dominant carriers of thermal energy in dielectric
and semiconducting crystals 
\cite{cahill_nanoscale_2003,mcconnell_thermal_2005,
srivastava_physics_1990,wallace_thermodynamics_1972,maradudin1974,
dove1993}. While
substantial effort has been devoted to developing theories of phonon
transport, the current understanding is incomplete, even in bulk 
materials. For
example, which phonon modes dominate thermal energy transport and the 
importance of
interactions involving four or more phonons are still being investigated 
\cite{wallace_thermodynamics_1972,srivastava_physics_1990,
broido_intrinsic_2007,esfarjani_heat_2011,cahill_nanoscale_2003}. The
situation becomes more complicated in nanostructures, where the phonons 
also interact with free surfaces and interfaces 
\cite{asheghi_phonon-boundary_1997,balandin_significant_1998,
lee_heat_1997,tian_importance_2011,hochbaum_enhanced_2008,
martin_impact_2009,he_thermal_2011,hopkins_reduction_2011,
landry_complex_2008,mcgaughey_size-independent_2011,
landry_effect_2009,landry_thermal_2009,landry2010}.

Analytical models of thermal transport, such as the Debye model, are limited by
the necessary approximations and assumptions \cite{callaway1959,holland1963,mcgaughey2011a}. 
With the Green-Kubo or
non-equilibrium direct methods, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can be used to predict thermal
conductivity, but only in a classical (i.e., high-temperature) framework 
\cite{ladd1986,mcgaughey2004c,landry2008,schelling2002,sellan2010a,esfarjani2011,turney2009a}. 
Because the analysis in these two MD-based methods is performed at the system level, 
no information about the phonons is obtained. Phonon specific heats, group velocities, 
and lifetimes are the required inputs for predicting thermal conductivity at the 
phonon-mode-level using  Boltzmann transport equation-based models 
\cite{ladd1986,mcgaughey2004c,mcgaughey2011a,sellan2010b,esfarjani2011,turney2009a,He2011a}.
These phonon properties can be predicted using harmonic and anharmonic lattice dynamics
calculations \cite{maradudin1962,wallace1972,ladd1986,dove1993,turney2009a,turney2009b},
 where quantum statistical effects can be naturally included. Anharmonic lattice dynamics 
calculations are limited to three-phonon scattering events, however, and are thus only valid at 
low temperatures \cite{turney2009a,esfarjani2011,wallace1972,srivastava1990}.

At high temperature, four-phonon and higher-order processes become important to thermal transport 
\cite{wallace1972,srivastava1990,turney2009a,esfarjani2011}. All orders of phonon processes are 
present in a MD simulation as the positions and momenta of the atoms are evolved using the full 
anharmonicity of the interatomic interactions \cite{mcgaughey2004c,esfarjani2011}. Phonon properties 
can be predicted from a MD simulation using normal mode analysis in the time domain 
\cite{ladd1986,mcgaughey2004c,henry2008,turney2009a,goicochea2010,He2011a}. In Section 
\ref{S:Subsection_NMD}, we will describe how this approach can be performed in the frequency-domain 
using the phonon spectral energy density (SED, referred to as $\Phi$). An alternative expression for 
the phonon SED (referred to as $\Phi'$), was recently proposed but has not been rigorously tested 
\cite{maruyama2003,shiomi2006,thomas2010c}. $\Phi^{'}$ was first used to predict the phonon 
dispersion curves of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) \cite{maruyama2003}. Thomas et al. used $\Phi'$ to
 predict the phonon lifetimes and thermal conductivity of isolated and water-filled CNTs, obtaining 
good agreement with other atomistic predictions \cite{thomas2010c}. The phonon lifetime reductions 
speculated for water-filled CNTs\cite{thomas2010c} and CNTs on SiO$_2$ substrates \cite{shiomi2011b} 
suggest that $\Phi'$ captures phonon physics at least qualitatively. The phonon lifetimes and thermal 
conductivity for PbTe \cite{qiu2011} and Half Heusler alloys \cite{shiomi2011a} have also been predicted 
using $\Phi'$. De Koker predicted the phonon lifetimes and thermal conductivity for MgO using an 
expression similar to $\Phi'$ (but different than $\Phi$) \cite{dekoker2009}. Another recent atomistic 
study using Stillinger-Weber silicon predicted phonon lifetimes using both $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$, but a 
detailed comparison of the predictions between the two was not performed \cite{Hori2012}.

The objective of this work is to assess the validity of $\Phi'$ as a phonon SED by comparing the phonon 
properties it predicts to those predicted by $\Phi$. In Section \ref{S:Subsection_NMD}, we present the 
correct phonon SED ($\Phi$), which requires the phonon mode eigenvectors. The expression for $\Phi$ is 
well-defined theoretically and has been tested and validated in previous studies in the time domain 
\cite{ladd1986,turney2009a}. In Section \ref{S:Subsection_Proposed_SED}, we present the proposed 
alternative expression for the phonon SED, $\Phi'$, which does not require the phonon mode eigenvector 
\cite{thomas2010c}. Phonon frequencies, lifetimes, and thermal conductivities are then predicted and 
compared using $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ for three test systems: Lennard-Jones (LJ) argon \cite{ashcroft1976} 
in Section \ref{S:Subsection_prop_LJ}, Stillinger-Weber (SW) silicon \cite{stillinger1985} in Section 
\ref{S:Subsection_prop_SW}, and an (8,8) CNT modeled with the reactive empirical bond order (REBO) potential 
\cite{brenner2002} in Section \ref{S:Subsection_prop_CNT}. While $\Phi'$ is found to accurately predict the 
phonon frequencies, we find that it does not correctly predict the phonon lifetimes because it does not 
capture the total phonon spectral energy density.

\section{\label{S:Section_NMD}Phonon Spectral Energy Density}

\subsection{\label{S:Subsection_NMD}As Derived from Normal Mode Coordinates, $\Phi$}

The correct expression for the phonon SED, $\Phi$, can be derived from the formulation of anharmonic 
lattice dynamics theory \cite{maradudin1974,wallace1972,dove1993,srivastava1990}. As shown in Ref. 
\cite{larkin2012a}, the phonon SED at wavevector $\pmb{\kappa}$ is a function of frequency, $\omega$, 
and is given by
\begin{equation}\label{E:Lorentzian_NMD}
\begin{split}
\Phi(\pmb{\kappa},\omega) = \sum_{\nu}^{3n}C_0\kv\frac{\Gamma\kv/\pi}{[\omega_0\kv-\omega]^2+\Gamma^2\kv},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
which is a superposition of $3n$ Lorentzian functions with centers at $\omega_0\kv$ and linewidths 
$\Gamma \kv$ (one for each polarization, $\nu$). The $C_0 \kv$ terms are mode-dependent constants. 
For simplicity, we refer to $\Phi(\pmb{\kappa},\omega)$ as $\Phi$. 
The
phonon kinetic energy normal mode coordinate, $\dot{q}\kvt$, is \cite{dove1993}
\begin{equation}\label{A:E:qdot_HLD}
\begin{split}
\dot{q}\kvt{}{}{}=&\SUM{0}{}\sqrt{\frac{m_b}{N}}\dot{u}_{\alpha}\lbt e^*\kvba\EXP{i\pmb{\kappa}\cdot\mathbf{r}_0\ab{l}{0}},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $e\kvba$ are the components of the time-independent phonon mode 
eigenvector (see Section \ref{Subsection_Comp_Details_2}), 
$n$ is the number of atoms in the unit cell, 
$m_b$ is the mass of the $b^{\textrm{th}}$ atom in the unit cell and
$\mathbf{r}_0\ab{l}{0}$ is the equilibrium position vector of the
$l^{\textrm{th}}$ unit cell. There are $N$ total unit cells and $\dot{u}_{\alpha}\lbt$ 
is the $\alpha$-component of the velocity of the
$b^{\textrm{th}}$ atom in the $l^{\textrm{th}}$ unit cell at time $t$.

Given a set of atomic velocities 
from MD simulation and the phonon mode eigenvector, $\Phi$ can be calculated using
\begin{equation}\label{A:E:Lorentzian_NMD}
\begin{split}
\Phi(\pmb{\kappa},\omega) = 2\sum_{\nu}^{3n} T\kvw=2\sum_{\nu}^{3n} 
\lim_{\tau_0\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{2\tau_0}\left|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{0}^{\tau_0}\dot{q}\kvt\exp(-i\omega t)dt\right|^2,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
and then fit using 
Equation \eqref{E:Lorentzian_NMD} to extract the phonon properties $\omega_0\kv$ and $\Gamma\kv$.
\cite{larkin2012a} 
The phonon lifetime, $\tau \kv$, is defined as $1/[2 \Gamma \kv]$. In practice, $\tau_0$ should 
be much larger than the longest phonon lifetime and the continuous fourier transform in 
Equation \eqref{A:E:Lorentzian_NMD}  
is performed using a discrete fast fourier transform (see Section \ref{S:Subsection_prop_LJ}, 
\ref{S:Subsection_prop_SW} and \ref{S:Subsection_prop_CNT}).

Previous work using normal mode analysis has represented the phonon energy in the time domain 
\cite{ladd1986,mcgaughey2004c,henry2008,turney2009a,goicochea2010,He2011a}, while $\Phi$ is a 
representation of the phonon energy in the frequency domain. The time- and frequency-domain 
approaches are mathematically equivalent by use of the Wiener-Khinchin theorem 
\cite{rudin1987,shiomi2011b}. The frequency-domain approach has the advantage of predicting 
both the phonon lifetime and frequency by fitting a simpler function than is required in the 
time-domain approach.

\subsection{\label{S:Subsection_Proposed_SED}Alternative Formulation, $\Phi'$}

We now seek to motivate the 
expression $\Phi'$ that was proposed in previous studies but has not been validated 
\cite{maruyama2003,shiomi2006,thomas2010c}. Thomas et al. \cite{thomas2010c} define
\begin{equation}\label{Lorentzian_SED}
\begin{split}
\Phi'(\pmb{\kappa},\omega) =& \frac{1}{4\pi\tau_0} \sum_\alpha^3 \sum_b^n \frac{m_b}{N}
\left| \sum_l^N  \int_{0}^{\tau_0} \dot{u}_{\alpha}\lbt \EXP{\Theta} dt \right|^2,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\Theta \equiv i[\pmb{\kappa}\cdot\mathbf{r}_0\ab{l}{0}-\omega t]$. 
To understand this expression, we start with the real-space atomic velocities as 
represented by the normal mode velocities, $\dot{q}\kpvt$ \cite{dove1993},
\begin{equation}\label{E:udot_HLD}
\begin{split}
\dot{u}_{\alpha}\lbt = &\SUMprime{2}{} \frac{1}{\sqrt{m_bN}} 
\EXP{i\pmb{\kappa}^{'}\cdot\mathbf{r}_0\ab{l}{0}} e^*\kpvba \dot{q}\kpvt{}{}{}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Fourier transforming both sides of Equation \eqref{E:udot_HLD} in time 
and space, taking the complex modulus, and summing over the atoms in the unit cell 
and the Cartesian directions yields
\begin{multline}\label{SED}
\lim_{\tau_0\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{4\pi\tau_0} \sum_\alpha^3 \sum_b^n \frac{m_b}{N} 
\left\lvert \sum_l^N  \int_{0}^{\tau_0} \dot{u}_{\alpha}\lbt \EXP{\Theta} dt \right\rvert^2 =
\\ \lim_{\tau_0\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{4\pi\tau_0} \sum_\alpha^3 \sum_b^n 
\left\lvert \frac{m_b^{3/2}}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_l^N \sum_{\nu}^{3n} e^*\kvba 
\int_{0}^{\tau_0}\dot{q}\kvt\EXP{\Theta}dt \right\rvert^2 ,
\end{multline}
where the the sum over $\pmb{\kappa}^{'}$ on the right-hand-side is reduced to a 
single wavevector by the orthogonality of the allowed wavevectors over the periodic 
domain. Equation \eqref{Lorentzian_SED} is the finite integration of the 
left-hand-side of Equation \eqref{SED}. For simplicity, we refer to $\Phi'(\pmb{\kappa},\omega)$ 
as $\Phi'$. Given a set of atomic velocities, Thomas et al. extract the phonon properties 
$\omega_0\kv$ and $\tau\kv$ from Equation \eqref{Lorentzian_SED} by fitting $\Phi'$ for a 
given wavevector to a superposition of Lorentzian functions.

Thomas et al. \cite{thomas2010c} claim that $\Phi'$ represents the phonon SED. As seen in 
Equation \eqref{E:udot_HLD}, the phonon mode eigenvectors are necessary to properly map
 between the atomic velocities and the normal mode coordinates. This need for the eigenvectors 
is the essential difference between the expressions for $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$. The potential 
advantage of $\Phi'$ is that other than the wavevectors, which can be determined from the 
crystal structure, no phonon properties need to be known {\em a priori}. However, to identify 
the degenerate modes in $\Phi'$, the phonon frequencies are necessary (see Section 
\ref{Subsection_Comp_Details_2}). Since $\Phi'$ does not require the phonon mode eigenvector, 
it can (in principle) be used to study disordered systems or perturbed crystalline systems 
(e.g. dilute alloys \cite{shiomi2011a}, water-filled CNTs \cite{thomas2010c}, and CNTs on 
substrates \cite{shiomi2011b}). Despite its use in previous studies, $\Phi'$ has not been 
rigorously validated.

\section{\label{Section_Comp}Computational Details}

\subsection{\label{Subsection_Comp_Details_1}Allowed Wavevectors}

Now that we have presented the two expressions for the phonon SED, we will 
provide the computational details of how they can be evaluated and used to predict 
phonon properties. The SED is defined for the allowed wavevectors of a crystal, which can 
be specified from the crystal structure's Bravais lattice, its basis (i.e., unit cell), and 
the size of the computational domain. A $D$-dimensional Bravais lattice is a collection of 
points with
positions
\begin{equation}\label{crys_pos}
\begin{split}
\mathbf{r}_0\ab{l}{0} =& \sum^D_{\alpha} N_{\alpha}\mathbf{a}_{\alpha},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{a}_{\alpha}$ are the lattice vectors and $N_{\alpha}$ is an integer 
\cite{dove1993}. The unit cell is the building block of the crystal and is placed on the 
points defined by the Bravais lattice. The equilibrium position of any atom in the crystal 
can be described by
\begin{equation}\label{crys_pos2}
\begin{split}
\mathbf{r}_0\ab{l}{b} = \mathbf{r}_0\ab{l}{0} + \mathbf{r}_0\ab{0}{b},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{r}_0\ab{0}{b}$ is the equilibrium position of the $b^{\textrm{th}}$ atom in 
the unit cell relative to $\mathbf{r}_0\ab{l}{0}$. The allowed wavevectors for any crystal 
structure are defined by
\begin{equation}\label{crys_pos3}
\begin{split}
\pmb{\kappa} = \sum_{\alpha} \mathbf{b}_{\alpha} \frac{n_{\alpha}}{N_{\alpha}},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{b}_{\alpha}$ are the reciprocal lattice vectors and $-N_{\alpha}/2 < 
n_{\alpha} \leq N_{\alpha}/2$, where $n_{\alpha}$ are integers and $N_{\alpha}$ are now 
constant even integers. The wavevectors are taken to be in the first Brillouin zone 
\cite{ashcroft1976}.

For the LJ argon and SW silicon systems studied here, the cubic conventional cells are 
used with four (argon) and eight (silicon) atoms per unit cell. For the MD simulations of
 LJ argon and SW silicon, cubic simulation domains are used (i.e., $N_1 = N_2 = N_3 = N_0$) 
\cite{mcgaughey2004c,turney2009a,sellan2010a}. For the CNT, the Brillouin zone is one-dimensional, 
so that $N_1 = N_2 = 1$, and we take $N_3=50$ \cite{thomas2010c}.

\subsection{\label{Subsection_Comp_Details_2}Phonon Lifetimes and Frequencies}

Once the allowed wavevectors are specified, the atomic velocities from an MD simulation can 
be used to calculate $\Phi'$ using Equation \eqref{Lorentzian_SED}. To calculate $\Phi$ 
[Equation \eqref{E:Lorentzian_NMD}], Equation (3) and (12) of 
Ref. \cite{larkin2012a} 
require the phonon mode eigenvector, which can be obtained using harmonic 
lattice dynamics calculations 
and the finite temperature lattice constant (i.e., quasi-harmonic lattice dynamics calculations) 
\cite{dove1993}. The $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ methods can used for any material system where there are 
available interatomic potentials.

The phonon frequencies and lifetimes are found by fitting the spectral curves $\Phi$ and 
$\Phi'$ with Lorentzian functions using a non-linear least squares method. Both of these 
phonon properties are independent of the Lorentzian peak magnitude. For $\Phi'$, the different 
polarizations at a given wavevector are superimposed by definition of Equation \eqref{Lorentzian_SED}. 
The different polarizations can be fit individually using single Lorentzian peaks or as a 
superposition of peaks. At high temperatures, the broadening of the peaks from different 
polarizations can make it difficult to uniquely locate the peaks in $\Phi'$. Knowledge of the 
quasi-harmonic frequencies is necessary to identify the unique peaks in $\Phi'$ as well as 
degeneracies \cite{mcgaughey2006b,turney2009a}.

$\Phi$ has the advantage that degenerate and nearly degenerate polarizations can be 
isolated and fit individually. The uncertainty in the predicted phonon frequencies is 
on the order of the frequency resolution used to perform the fast Fourier transforms 
required to evaluate $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$, which is $10^2-10^4$ less than the phonon frequencies 
studied in this work (see Sections \ref{S:Subsection_prop_LJ}, \ref{S:Subsection_prop_SW}, 
and \ref{S:Subsection_prop_CNT}). At the temperatures studied in this work, we find that 
fitting single or simultaneous peaks in either $\Phi$ or $\Phi'$ results in less than five 
percent difference in the predicted lifetimes. The uncertainty from fitting the Lorentzian 
functions is between five and ten percent of the predicted lifetimes, with the error increasing 
with increasing temperature.\footnote[1]{The range of data must be selected when fitting the 
Lorentzian functions to $\Phi$ or $\Phi'$. This range should be large enough for the Lorentzian 
functions to decrease significantly from their value at
half-width at half-maximum, where the linewidth is specified, but not too large as to pick up 
noise. The error in predicting the lifetime is obtained by varying the range of data
used to fit the Lorentzian function.}

To illustrate the procedure, $\Phi$ was calculated for LJ argon (Section 
\ref{S:Subsection_prop_LJ}) with $N_0=8$ and $T=20$ K, where $T$ is temperature. 
$\Phi$ for the three modes of lowest frequency and wavevector $[\pi/4a,\pi/4a,\pi/4a]$ 
is shown in Fig$.$ \ref{F:LJ_FIT_PEAK}. The lower-frequency peak corresponds to the two 
degenerate transverse acoustic modes, while the higher frequency peak corresponds to the 
longitudinal acoustic mode \cite{dove1993}.

\vspace*{0mm}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[angle=0,width=65.0mm]{figure1.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{F:LJ_FIT_PEAK} The SED (using $\Phi$) for the first three polarizations at 
the wavevector $[\pi/4a,\pi/4a,\pi/4a]$ for LJ argon at a temperature of 20 K. There are 
two degenerate transverse acoustic (TA) polarizations and one longitudinal acoustic (LA) 
polarization. When fitting the SED, the different polarizations can be fit individually 
using single Lorentzian peaks or as a superposition of polarizations. Here the two peaks 
are fit individually with $\Phi$ plotted as a superposition. The predicted lifetimes, 
which are inversely proportional to $\Gamma$ are provided in the legend.}
\end{figure}



\subsection{\label{Subsection_Comp_Details_3}Thermal Conductivity}

Once the frequencies and lifetimes of all phonon modes in the first
Brillouin zone are obtained, the bulk thermal conductivity in direction
$\mathbf{n}$, $k_{\mathbf{n}}$, can be calculated from \cite{ziman2001}
\begin{equation}\label{E-size:k_bulk}\
\begin{split}
k_{\mathbf{n}}=&\sum_{\pmb{\kappa}} \sum_\nu c_{ph} \kv v^{2}_{g,\mathbf{n}} \kv \tau \kv.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Here, $c_{ph}$ is the phonon volumetric specific heat and ${v}_{g,\mathbf{n}}$ is
the component of the group velocity vector in direction $\mathbf{n}$. Since the systems 
we consider are classical and obey Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics \cite{mcquarrie2000}, the
specific heat is $k_{\mathrm{B}}$ per mode in the harmonic limit, where $k_{\mathrm{B}}$ 
is the Boltzmann constant. As temperature increases, anharmonicity causes the mode specific 
heats to deviate from $k_{\mathrm{B}}$ \cite{mcgaughey2004c}. The effect is small for the 
systems and temperatures studied here. For LJ argon, the mode-averaged specific heat has 
been predicted to be $0.95k_{\mathrm{B}}$ per mode at a temperature of $40$ K and approaches 
$k_{\mathrm{B}}$ with decreasing temperature \cite{mcgaughey2004c}. For SW silicon at a 
temperature of $300$ K, the predicted mode-averaged specific heat is $1.01k_{\mathrm{B}}$ 
per mode \cite{goicochea2010}. For the CNT at $T=300$ K, we predict the mode-averaged 
specific heat to be $1.03k_{\mathrm{B}}$ per mode. Because we do not have mode-dependent 
specific heats, we take the specific heat to be $k_{\mathrm{B}}$ per mode for the three 
systems studied (argon, silicon, and CNT).  The group velocity vector is the gradient of 
the dispersion curve (i.e., $\partial \omega / \partial \pmb{\kappa}$) and can be calculated 
from the frequencies and wavevectors using finite differences. In this work, the group 
velocities are calculated using the frequencies from quasi-harmonic lattice dynamics 
calculations because a smaller finite difference in wavevector can be used than what is 
available from the MD simulations (see Section \ref{Subsection_Comp_Details_1}).
\footnote[2]{The anharmonic frequency shift affects the group velocity. 
McGaughey and Kaviany find that anharmonic and quasi-harmonic predictions of 
the group velocity differ for LJ Argon by less than one percent at a temperature of 
$50$ K and that the difference decreases with decreasing temperature \cite{mcgaughey2004c}. 
The anharmonic frequency shifts are on average a few percent for LJ argon at a temperature 
of $40$ K and are less for the other temperatures and systems studied here.}

\subsection{\label{Subsection_Comp_Details_4}Computational Cost}

The computational cost of evaluating Equation \eqref{Lorentzian_SED} is less than that for 
Equation \eqref{E:Lorentzian_NMD} by a factor of $3b$, where $b$ is the number of atoms in the 
unit cell.  For bulk crystals, the number of atoms in the unit cell is typically small 
($b<10$).  For the (8,8) CNT system, $b=32$ and evaluating $\Phi'$ is two orders of magnitude 
less expensive than evaluating $\Phi$.

To calculate the phonon lifetimes, the MD simulation time should be an order of magnitude 
longer than the longest phonon lifetime \cite{thomasthesis}.  If only the phonon frequencies 
are required, however, the location of the peaks in $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ develop in a time on 
the order of the inverse of the phonon frequency, $1/\omega_0\kv$. For the systems studied 
here, this time can be two to five orders of magnitude less than the time needed to develop 
the lifetimes.

Fitting $\Phi'$ becomes challenging at higher temperatures, when the phonon linewidths 
broaden and become comparable to the spacing between mode frequencies. The cost of 
fitting $\Phi'$ can be reduced by fitting the peaks from all allowed wavevectors in the 
system simultaneously, but the error associated with this procedure is unknown 
\cite{shiomi2011a}. We find that a semi-automated procedure, whereby the fits are 
visualized, is necessary to ensure that all peaks are fit correctly.  While the 
computational cost of fitting $\Phi'$ is much smaller than the computational cost of 
calculating $\Phi'$, the semi-automated fitting procedure can be of similar time cost 
to the user. The cost of fitting $\Phi$ is much smaller because the different polarization 
peaks can be isolated and the fitting can be fully automated.

\section{\label{S:Section_Prop}Case Studies}

\subsection{\label{S:Subsection_prop_LJ}Lennard-Jones Argon}

We now use MD simulation to compare the SED, phonon properties, and thermal conductivity 
calculated for LJ argon using $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$. The MD simulations are performed using 
LAMMPS \cite{LAMMPS}. A truncated and shifted
potential cutoff scheme is used with a cutoff radius of 8.5 $\AA$. The quasi-harmonic 
phonon frequencies, eigenvectors, and group velocities are generated using GULP \cite{GULP}.
 We consider temperatures of 5, 20, and 40 K at zero-pressure with lattice constants of 
5.278, 5.315, and 5.371 $\AA$. For LJ argon, Turney et al. found that lattice dynamics-based 
predictions of thermal conductivity (e.g., by anharmonic lattice dynamics or $\Phi$) start to 
diverge from MD-based predictions (e.g., from the direct or Green-Kubo methods) above half the 
melting temperature ($T_{\mathrm{melt}} \approx 80$ K) \cite{turney2009a}. Here, we limit the 
temperature to below half the melting temperature for the three systems studied (argon, 
silicon, and CNT).

The MD system consists of $N_1 \times N_2 \times N_3 = 8^3 = 512$ conventional cubic unit 
cells for a total of 2048 atoms ($b=4$ atoms). Using a 4.285 fs time step, the system is 
equilibrated for $2^{20}$ time steps before collecting data every $2^5$ time steps for an 
additional $2^{20}$ time steps in the $NVE$ ensemble (constant number of atoms, system volume, 
and total system energy) \cite{mcquarrie2000}. The sampling rate must be high enough to capture 
the highest phonon frequency in the system. The sampling rate and total run time are chosen in 
powers of two as a convenience in performing the fast Fourier transforms required to efficiently 
evaluate $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$. The same MD simulation data are used to calculate $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$.  
Five simulations with different initial conditions are performed and the $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ 
values are averaged before the peak fitting. $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ are further averaged over 
degenerate wavevectors in the Brillouin zone, reducing the wavevectors to the first octant 
\cite{mcgaugheythesis}.

The SED ($\Phi$ and $\Phi'$) for the wavevector [$\pi/2a$,0,0] is presented in Fig$.$ 
\ref{F:PEAK_COMPARE} for all three temperatures (the edge of the Brillouin zone is at 
[$\pi/a$,0,0]).  For $\Phi$, the spectral curve is plotted as a superposition over the 
twelve phonon polarizations, with degeneracy reducing the number of peaks to seven.  Overall, 
$\Phi'$ does not equal the total phonon spectral energy density $\Phi$, but the major features 
are similar. At all temperatures there are linewdith variations between the two spectral curves. 
The peak magnitudes become comparable for $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ as the temperature increases.

\caption{\label{F:PEAK_COMPARE} The phonon spectral energy density ($\Phi$) is plotted as 
larger blue circles.  The proposed alternative expression for the phonon spectral energy 
density ($\Phi'$) is plotted as smaller green points. The wavevector is ($\pi/2a$,0,0). Note 
that peak broadening at higher temperatures and frequencies above $10$ rads/ps can force peaks 
close in frequency for $\Phi'$ to be fit as a single Lorentzian function. $\Phi$ does not suffer 
from this issue since the broadened peaks can be fit individually.}
\end{figure}

The phonon frequencies and lifetimes extracted for all allowed wavevectors in the first Brillouin 
zone using $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ at each of the three temperatures are compared on a mode-by-mode 
basis in Figs$.$ \ref{F:FREQ_LIFE_LJ}(a), \ref{F:FREQ_LIFE_LJ}(b), and \ref{F:FREQ_LIFE_LJ}(c). 
There, $\omega_0$, $\omega_0^{'}$, $\tau$, and $\tau^{'}$  refer to the mode properties predicted 
using $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$. The phonon frequencies agree well at all three temperatures, with 
increasing scatter at high temperatures and high frequencies.  This scatter is due to the high-frequency 
peak broadening seen in Fig$.$ \ref{F:PEAK_COMPARE} at $T = 40$ K, which can force peaks close in 
frequency for $\Phi'$ to be fit as a single Lorentzian function. The frequencies predicted by $\Phi$ 
and $\Phi'$ include the effects of anharmonicity, which increase the frequencies compared to the 
quasi-harmonic predictions \cite{mcgaughey2004c,turney2009a}. The agreement between the frequencies 
predicted from $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ is explained in Ref. \cite{larkin2012a}.

The lifetimes show large scatter between $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ on a mode-by-mode basis, with increasing 
scatter at high temperature that shows no systematic difference. The scatter at high frequencies 
is in part due to the peak broadening seen in Fig$.$ \ref{F:PEAK_COMPARE}, which can force peaks 
close in frequency for $\Phi'$ to be fit as a single Lorentzian function with a single lifetime. 
The broadening does not affect fitting at low frequencies, where the linewidths are much smaller 
than the peak spacings. There, any scatter comes solely from the difference between $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$.

The phonon properties are then used to predict thermal conductivity using Equation 
\eqref{E-size:k_bulk}. The results are presented in Table \ref{T:cond_table}. The bulk thermal 
conductivities provided in Table \ref{T:cond_table} are predicted using the finite simulation-size 
scaling procedure discussed in \cite{turney2009a}. The bulk thermal conductivities predicted from 
$\Phi'$ are smaller and outside the uncertainty for those predicted from $\Phi$ for temperatures of 
$5$ and $20$ K. While the bulk thermal conductivities at a temperature of $40$ K agree within their 
uncertainties, the predicted mode-by-mode lifetimes show large scatter [Fig$.$ \ref{F:FREQ_LIFE_LJ}(c)] 
and the agreement should be regarded as coincidental.

The disagreement between $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ in thermal conductivity comes directly from the differences 
in the phonon lifetimes. All other properties (frequencies, group velocities, specific heats) are 
nearly or exactly the same for the two calculations. The bulk thermal conductivities predicted from 
$\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ are also compared to predictions from the Green-Kubo method\cite{mcquarrie2000} in 
Table \ref{T:cond_table}. For $N_1=N_2=N_3=8$, the thermal conductivity predicted by the Green-Kubo 
method is converged with respect to the simulation size \cite{mcgaughey2004c}. The same MD data used 
to calculate $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ is used for the Green-Kubo predictions. For all three temperatures, 
there is good agreement between the thermal conductivity predictions using $\Phi$ and Green-Kubo. For 
temperatures of $20$ and $40$ K, there is good agreement between the predictions from $\Phi$, Green-Kubo, 
and previous reports using non-equilibrium MD, anharmonic lattice dynamics, and time-domain $\Phi$ 
\cite{turney2009a}.

those from $\Phi'$ differ and show no consistent behavior. The uncertainties in the predicted thermal 
conductivities for $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ come predominantly from the finite simulation-size scaling 
procedure (see Ref. \cite{turney2009a,He2011a}), where the phonon properties and thermal conductivity 
are predicted for increasing system sizes ($N_1=N_2=N_3$) to extrapolate a bulk thermal conductivity. 
For SW silicon and the CNT, the extrapolation procedure is not performed. }

\subsection{\label{S:Subsection_prop_SW}Stillinger-Weber Silicon}

We next compare the phonon properties and thermal conductivity predicted from $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ 
for SW silicon \cite{stillinger1985} at a temperature of $300$ K and zero pressure with a lattice 
constant of 5.437 $\AA$. The SW system is stiffer (larger phonon group velocities, frequencies, and 
lifetimes) than LJ argon and is an additional test to determine if there is a systematic error in 
the predictions from $\Phi'$. The MD simulations are performed using LAMMPS \cite{LAMMPS}. The MD 
system consists
of $N_1 \times N_2 \times N_3 = 6^3 = 216$ conventional unit cells for a total of 1728 atoms 
($b=8$ atoms). The phonon frequencies, eigenvectors, and group velocities are generated using 
GULP \cite{GULP}.

Using a 0.5 fs timestep, the system is equilibrated for $2^{20}$ time steps before collecting 
data every $2^5$ time step for $2^{22}$ time steps in the $NVE$ ensemble \cite{mcquarrie2000}. 
As with the LJ system, the sampling rate is determined by the highest phonon frequency in the 
system. Five simulations with different initial conditions are performed and the $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ 
values are averaged before the peak fitting. $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ are further averaged over degenerate 
wavevectors in the Brillouin zone, reducing the wavevectors to the first octant \cite{mcgaugheythesis}.

The extracted phonon frequencies and lifetimes are plotted in Fig$.$ \ref{F:FREQ_LIFE_Si}. 
As with the LJ system, the phonon frequencies are predicted accurately by $\Phi'$ but the 
lifetimes show large scatter on a mode-by-mode basis. For the system size studied, $\Phi'$ 
predicts a larger thermal conductivity than $\Phi$ outside the prediction uncertainties, in 
contrast to the LJ system (see Table \ref{T:cond_table}). The disagreement 
in thermal conductivity comes directly from the phonon lifetimes.

\subsection{\label{S:Subsection_prop_CNT}Carbon Nanotube}

Finally, we compare the phonon properties and thermal conductivities predicted by $\Phi$ and 
$\Phi'$ for an (8,8) CNT (diameter of 1.10-nm and length of 12.3 nm) at a temperature of $300$ K 
and zero pressure \cite{thomas2010c}. The interactions in the CNT system are modeled using the 
REBO potential without the four-body interaction term \cite{brenner2002}. The MD simulations are 
performed using an in-house code. The MD system consists of 1600 atoms (32 atoms/unit cell). The 
phonon frequencies, eigenvectors, and group velocities are generated using an in-house code. The 
purpose of simulating this system is to check the results of Thomas et al.\cite{thomas2010c} (who 
used $\Phi'$ and non-equilibrium MD), and to compare the predictions of $\Phi'$ and $\Phi$.

Using a 1.0 fs timestep, the system is equilibrated for $2^{20}$ time steps before collecting data 
every $2^3$ time step for $2^{22}$ time steps in the $NVE$ ensemble \cite{mcquarrie2000}. As with 
the LJ and SW systems, the sampling rate is determined by the highest phonon frequency in the 
system. Five simulations with different initial conditions are performed and the $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ 
values are averaged before the peak fitting. Since the Brillouin zone of the CNT is 
one-dimensional, $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ are further averaged over directionally-degenerate wavevectors.

The phonon frequencies and lifetimes for the allowed wavevectors in the one-dimensional Brillouin 
zone are shown in Fig. \ref{F:FREQ_LIFE_CNT}. Like the LJ and SW silicon systems, the 
phonon frequencies can be predicted accurately by $\Phi'$, but the lifetimes show large scatter. 
The estimated thermal conductivity of the CNT predicted using $\Phi'$ is in agreement with the 
results of Thomas et al. \cite{thomas2010c}. The thermal conductivity predicted by $\Phi'$ is less 
than that predicted by $\Phi$, but not outside their uncertainties.

\section{\label{Section_Conclusions}Summary}

We presented the correct phonon SED, $\Phi$, and its relation to the phonon frequencies and lifetimes. 
We then presented an alternative formulation to the 
phonon spectral energy density, $\Phi'$, which does not require the phonon mode eigenvectors.  
Because $\Phi'$ does not contain the eigenvectors, this alternative formulation does not represent 
the phonon spectral energy density, but does contain information about the phonon dispersion as the 
temperature approaches $0$ K (see Ref. \cite{larkin2012a}).

We then calculated the phonon SED for LJ argon, SW silicon, and a CNT modeled with the REBO 
potential using $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$. The phonon frequencies and
lifetimes predicted from $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ are shown in Figs$.$ \ref{F:FREQ_LIFE_LJ}, 
\ref{F:FREQ_LIFE_Si} and \ref{F:FREQ_LIFE_CNT}. The
frequencies are in good agreement between the two SED methods, while the lifetimes show large scatter.

The phonon SED $\Phi$ is well-defined theoretically, while $\Phi'$ does not properly map to the 
phonon energies since it is missing the phonon mode eigenvector. We deduce that this is the reason 
$\Phi'$ does not accurately predict the phonon lifetimes. It is surprising how close the predicted 
thermal conductivities can be using $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ (LJ at $T=40$ K and the CNT results). The 
thermal conductivities predicted by $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$, however, show no consistency for the three 
systems studied.

The most important predictions are the mode-by-mode phonon properties. Of particular importance are 
the lifetimes, which are the key input for Boltzmann transport equation-based models 
\cite{mcgaughey2011a}. Thus, we do not recommend $\Phi'$ for predicting phonon lifetimes or 
thermal conductivity.  Any agreement in thermal conductivity predictions between atomistic 
studies\cite{thomas2010c} and experiment\cite{dekoker2009,qiu2011} should be regarded as 
coincidental, and the phonon lifetime reductions predicted for systems with additional scattering 
methods \cite{thomas2010c,shiomi2011a} should only be interpreted qualitatively. The use of $\Phi'$ 
in future work is discouraged and we reccomend the use of $\Phi$.
