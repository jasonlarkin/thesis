\contentsline {table}{\numberline {A.1}{\ignorespaces Thermal conductivity values in W/m-K predicted using the $\Phi $, $\Phi '$, and Green-Kubo methods. The predictions for $\Phi $ and Green-Kubo for the LJ system are in good agreement with those from other atomistic simulation methods \cite {turney_predicting_2009} while those from $\Phi '$ differ and show no consistent behavior. The uncertainties in the predicted thermal conductivities for $\Phi $ and $\Phi '$ come predominantly from the finite simulation-size scaling procedure (see Ref. \cite {turney_predicting_2009,he_thermal_2011}), where the phonon properties and thermal conductivity are predicted for increasing system sizes ($N_1=N_2=N_3$) to extrapolate a bulk thermal conductivity. For SW silicon and the CNT, the extrapolation procedure is not performed. }}{20}{table.A.1}
