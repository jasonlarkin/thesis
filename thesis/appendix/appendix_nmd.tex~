\chapter{Vibrational Lifetimes from Molecular Dynamics}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two frequency-domain methods for predicting phonon frequencies and 
lifetimes
using the phonon spectral energy density are described. Both methods draw
input from molecular dynamics simulations and lattice dynamics 
calculations,
but differ in the form of the phonon spectral energy density.
One phonon spectral energy density expression (referred to as $\Phi$) 
can be
formally derived from lattice dynamics theory. A similar approach in the
time domain has been validated [Turney et al. \emph{Phys. Rev. B} 
\textbf{79}, 224305
(2009)]. The other phonon spectral energy density expression 
(referred to as
$\Phi'$) has been proposed [Thomas et al., \emph{Phys. Rev. B} 
\textbf{81}, 081411(R) (2010)]
but not validated. The expressions for $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ are 
presented and then
applied to predict the phonon properties and thermal conductivities 
of three
systems: Lennard-Jones argon, Stillinger-Weber silicon, and a carbon
nanotube modeled using the Reactive Empirical Bond Order potential. 
$\Phi'$ does not capture the total
phonon spectral energy density predicted by $\Phi$ and therefore 
cannot
correctly predict the phonon lifetimes or thermal conductivity. Its 
use infuture work is discouraged and we reccomend the use of $\Phi$.

\section{\label{Section_Introduction}Introduction}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phonons are the dominant carriers of thermal energy in dielectric
and semiconducting crystals 
\cite{cahill_nanoscale_2003,mcconnell_thermal_2005,
srivastava_physics_1990,wallace_thermodynamics_1972,
maradudin_dynamical_1974,dove_introduction_1993}. While
substantial effort has been devoted to developing theories of phonon
transport, the current understanding is incomplete, even in bulk 
materials. For
example, which phonon modes dominate thermal energy transport and the 
importance of
interactions involving four or more phonons are still being investigated 
\cite{wallace_thermodynamics_1972,srivastava_physics_1990,
broido_intrinsic_2007,esfarjani_heat_2011,cahill_nanoscale_2003}. The
situation becomes more complicated in nanostructures, where the phonons 
also interact with free surfaces and interfaces 
\cite{asheghi_phonon-boundary_1997,balandin_significant_1998,
lee_heat_1997,tian_importance_2011,hochbaum_enhanced_2008,
martin_impact_2009,he_thermal_2011,hopkins_reduction_2011,
landry_complex_2008,mcgaughey_size-independent_2011,
landry_effect_2009,landry_thermal_2009,landry_effect_2010}.

Analytical models of thermal transport, such as the Debye model, are 
limited by
the necessary approximations and assumptions
\cite{callaway_model_1959,holland_analysis_1963,
mcgaughey_size-dependent_2011}. 
With the Green-Kubo or
non-equilibrium direct methods, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can 
be used to predict thermal
conductivity, but only in a classical (i.e., high-temperature) framework 
\cite{ladd_lattice_1986,mcgaughey_quantitative_2004,landry_complex_2008,
schelling_comparison_2002,sellan_size_2010,esfarjani_heat_2011,
turney_predicting_2009}. 
Because the analysis in these two MD-based methods is performed at the 
system level, 
no information about the phonons is obtained. Phonon specific heats, 
group velocities, 
and lifetimes are the required inputs for predicting thermal 
conductivity at the 
phonon-mode-level using  Boltzmann transport equation-based models 
\cite{ladd_lattice_1986,mcgaughey_quantitative_2004,
mcgaughey_size-dependent_2011,
sellan_size_2010,esfarjani_heat_2011,turney_predicting_2009,
he_thermal_2011}.
These phonon properties can be predicted using harmonic and anharmonic 
lattice dynamics
calculations 
\cite{maradudin_scattering_1962,wallace_thermodynamics_1972,
ladd_lattice_1986,dove_introduction_1993,
turney_predicting_2009,turney_assesing_2009},
 where quantum statistical effects can be naturally included. Anharmonic 
 lattice dynamics 
calculations are limited to three-phonon scattering events, however, and 
are thus only valid at 
low temperatures 
\cite{turney_predicting_2009,esfarjani_heat_2011,
wallace_thermodynamics_1972,srivastava_physics_1990}.

At high temperature, four-phonon and higher-order processes become 
important to thermal transport 
\cite{wallace_thermodynamics_1972,srivastava_physics_1990,
turney_predicting_2009,esfarjani_heat_2011}. All orders of 
phonon processes are 
present in a MD simulation as the positions and momenta of the atoms are 
evolved using the full 
anharmonicity of the interatomic interactions 
\cite{mcgaughey_quantitative_2004,esfarjani_heat_2011}. Phonon properties 
can be predicted from a MD simulation using normal mode analysis in the 
time domain 
\cite{ladd_lattice_1986,mcgaughey_quantitative_2004,henry_spectral_2008,
turney_predicting_2009,goicochea_thermal_2010,he_thermal_2011}. 
In Section 
\ref{S:Subsection_NMD}, we will describe how this approach can be performed 
in the frequency-domain 
using the phonon spectral energy density (SED, referred to as $\Phi$). An 
alternative expression for 
the phonon SED (referred to as $\Phi'$), was recently proposed but has not 
been rigorously tested 
\cite{maruyama_molecular_2003,shiomi_non-fourier_2006,
thomas_predicting_2010}. $\Phi^{'}$ was first used to 
predict the phonon 
dispersion curves of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) 
\cite{maruyama_molecular_2003}. 
Thomas et al. used $\Phi'$ to 
predict the phonon lifetimes and thermal conductivity of isolated and 
water-filled CNTs, obtaining 
good agreement with other atomistic predictions 
\cite{thomas_predicting_2010}. The phonon lifetime reductions 
speculated for water-filled CNTs
\cite{thomas_predicting_2010} and CNTs on SiO$_2$ 
substrates \cite{ong_reduction_2011} 
suggest that $\Phi'$ captures phonon physics at least qualitatively. The 
phonon lifetimes and thermal 
conductivity for PbTe \cite{qiu_molecular_2011} and Half Heusler alloys 
\cite{shiomi_thermal_2011} have also been predicted 
using $\Phi'$. De Koker predicted the phonon lifetimes and thermal 
conductivity for MgO using an 
expression similar to $\Phi'$ (but different than $\Phi$) 
\cite{dekoker_thermal_2009}. Another recent atomistic 
study using Stillinger-Weber silicon predicted phonon lifetimes using 
both $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$, but a 
detailed comparison of the predictions between the two was not performed 
\cite{hori_mode-dependent_2012}.

The objective of this work is to assess the validity of $\Phi'$ as a 
phonon SED by comparing the phonon 
properties it predicts to those predicted by $\Phi$. In Section 
\ref{S:Subsection_NMD}, we present the 
correct phonon SED ($\Phi$), which requires the phonon mode eigenvectors. 
The expression for $\Phi$ is 
well-defined theoretically and has been tested and validated in previous 
studies in the time domain 
\cite{ladd_lattice_1986,turney_predicting_2009}. 
In Section \ref{S:Subsection_Proposed_SED}, 
we present the proposed 
alternative expression for the phonon SED, $\Phi'$, which does not require 
the phonon mode eigenvector 
\cite{thomas_predicting_2010}. Phonon frequencies, lifetimes, and thermal 
conductivities are then predicted and 
compared using $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ for three test systems: Lennard-Jones 
(LJ) argon \cite{ashcroft_solid_1976} 
in Section \ref{S:Subsection_prop_LJ}, Stillinger-Weber (SW) silicon 
\cite{stillinger_computer_1985} in Section 
\ref{S:Subsection_prop_SW}, and an (8,8) CNT modeled with the reactive 
empirical bond order (REBO) potential 
\cite{brenner_second_2002} in Section \ref{S:Subsection_prop_CNT}. 
While $\Phi'$ 
is found to accurately predict the 
phonon frequencies, we find that it does not correctly predict the phonon 
lifetimes because it does not 
capture the total phonon spectral energy density.

\subsection{\label{S:Subsection_NMD}As Derived from Normal Mode 
Coordinates, $\Phi$}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The correct expression for the phonon SED, $\Phi$, can be derived from 
the formulation of anharmonic 
lattice dynamics theory 
\cite{maradudin_dynamical_1974,wallace_thermodynamics_1972,
dove_introduction_1993,srivastava_physics_1990}. 
As shown in Appendix (REF), the phonon SED at wavevector $\pmb{\kappa}$ 
is a function of frequency, $\omega$, 
and is given by
\begin{equation}\label{E:Lorentzian_NMD}
\begin{split}
\Phi(\pmb{\kappa},\omega) = \sum_{\nu}^{3n}C_0\kv\frac{\Gamma\kv/\pi}
{[\omega_0\kv-\omega]^2+\Gamma^2\kv},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
which is a superposition of $3n$ Lorentzian functions with centers at 
$\omega_0\kv$ and linewidths 
$\Gamma \kv$ (one for each polarization, $\nu$). The $C_0 \kv$ terms 
are mode-dependent constants. 
For simplicity, we refer to $\Phi(\pmb{\kappa},\omega)$ as $\Phi$. 
The
phonon kinetic energy normal mode coordinate, $\dot{q}\kvt$, is 
\cite{dove_introduction_1993}
\begin{equation}\label{A:E:qdot_HLD}
\begin{split}
\dot{q}\kvt{}{}{}=&\SUM{0}{}\sqrt{\frac{m_b}{N}}\dot{u}_{\alpha}\lbt 
e^*\kvba\EXP{i\pmb{\kappa}\cdot\mathbf{r}_0\ab{l}{0}},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $e\kvba$ are the components of the time-independent phonon mode 
eigenvector (see Section \ref{Subsection_Comp_Details_2}), 
$n$ is the number of atoms in the unit cell, 
$m_b$ is the mass of the $b^{\textrm{th}}$ atom in the unit cell and
$\mathbf{r}_0\ab{l}{0}$ is the equilibrium position vector of the
$l^{\textrm{th}}$ unit cell. There are $N$ total unit cells and 
$\dot{u}_{\alpha}\lbt$ 
is the $\alpha$-component of the velocity of the
$b^{\textrm{th}}$ atom in the $l^{\textrm{th}}$ unit cell at time $t$.

Given a set of atomic velocities 
from MD simulation and the phonon mode eigenvector, $\Phi$ can be 
calculated using
\begin{equation}\label{A:E:Lorentzian_NMD}
\begin{split}
\Phi(\pmb{\kappa},\omega) = 2\sum_{\nu}^{3n} T\kvw=2\sum_{\nu}^{3n} 
\lim_{\tau_0\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{2\tau_0}\left|
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{0}^{\tau_0}\dot{q}\kvt
\exp(-i\omega t)dt\right|^2,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
and then fit using 
Equation \eqref{E:Lorentzian_NMD} to extract the phonon properties 
$\omega_0\kv$ and $\Gamma\kv$.
 
The phonon lifetime, $\tau \kv$, is defined as $1/[2 \Gamma \kv]$. 
In practice, $\tau_0$ should 
be much larger than the longest phonon lifetime and the continuous 
fourier transform in 
Equation \eqref{A:E:Lorentzian_NMD}  
is performed using a discrete fast fourier transform (see Section 
\ref{S:Subsection_prop_LJ}, 
\ref{S:Subsection_prop_SW} and \ref{S:Subsection_prop_CNT}).

Previous work using normal mode analysis has represented the phonon 
energy in the time domain 
\cite{ladd_lattice_1986,mcgaughey_quantitative_2004,
henry_spectral_2008,turney_predicting_2009,
goicochea_thermal_2010,he_thermal_2011}, while $\Phi$ is a 
representation of the phonon energy in the frequency domain. The 
time- and frequency-domain 
approaches are mathematically equivalent by use of the 
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener\%E2\%80\%93Khinchin_theorem}
{Wiener-Khinchin theorem} 
\cite{rudin_real_1987,shiomi_thermal_2011}. The frequency-domain 
approach has the 
advantage of predicting 
both the phonon lifetime and frequency by fitting a simpler function 
than is required in the 
time-domain approach.

\subsection{\label{Appendix_A}Derivation of Phonon Spectral Energy Density, 
$\Phi$}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
(WORK)


To derive the correct expression for the phonon SED, $\Phi$, we begin 
with harmonic lattice dynamics theory.\cite{wallace_thermodynamics_1972,
dove_introduction_1993} The 
derivation outlined here is presented in detail in Appendix 
\ref{Appendix_A}.

In reciprocal space, the system Hamiltonian, $H$, is
\begin{equation}\label{E:H_HLD}
\begin{split}
H=&\frac{1}{2}\SUM{}{}\left[\dot{q}^*\kvt \dot{q}\kvt + \omega_0^2\kv 
q^*\kvt q\kvt\right]\\
 =&\SUM{}{}\left[T\kvt + V\kvt\right],
 \end{split}
\end{equation}
where $t$ is time, $\omega_0\kv$ is the frequency of the phonon mode 
denoted by
wave vector $\pmb{\kappa}$ and dispersion branch $\nu$, and $N$ and 
$n$ are
the total number of unit cells and the number of atoms in the unit cell.
The
Hamiltonian is the total system energy and is the sum of the mode- and
time-dependent kinetic and potential energies, $T\kvt$ and $V\kvt$.  The
phonon normal mode coordinate, $q\kvt$ and its time derivative, 
$q\kvt$, are given by
\begin{equation}\label{E:q_HLD}
\begin{split}
q\kvt=&\SUM{0}{}\sqrt{\frac{m_b}{N}}u_{\alpha}\lbt e^*\kvba
\EXP{i\pmb{\kappa}\cdot\mathbf{r}_0\ab{l}{0}}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{E:qdot_HLD}
\begin{split}
\dot{q}\kvt{}{}{}=&\SUM{0}{}\sqrt{\frac{m_b}{N}}\dot{u}_{\alpha}\lbt
e^*\kvba\EXP{i\pmb{\kappa}\cdot\mathbf{r}_0\ab{l}{0}},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $m_b$ is the mass of the $b^{\textrm{th}}$ atom in the unit cell and
$\mathbf{r}_0\ab{l}{0}$ is the equilibrium position vector of the
$l^{\textrm{th}}$ unit cell. The $\alpha$-component of the displacement from
equilibrium, $u_{\alpha}\lbt$, and velocity, $\dot{u}_{\alpha}\lbt$, of the
$b^{\textrm{th}}$ atom in the $l^{\textrm{th}}$ unit cell are time-dependent
and are related to the phonon mode coordinates through the time-independent
eigenvector that has components $e\kvba$.

The expectation value of the kinetic energy of each normal mode in
the time domain is
\begin{equation}\label{A:E:ave_T_t}
\begin{split}
\langle T\kv \rangle=&\lim_{\tau_0\rightarrow\infty}
\frac{1}{2\tau_0}\int_{0}^{\tau_0}\dot{q}^*\kvt\dot{q}\kvt dt.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The expectation value of the kinetic energy of the normal mode can
be transformed from the time domain to the
frequency domain by Parseval's theorem,\cite{rudin_real_1987}
\begin{equation}\label{E:ave_T_w1}
\begin{split}
T\kvw=&\lim_{\tau_0\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{2\tau_0}
\left|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{0}^{\tau_0}\dot{q}\kvt
\exp(-i\omega t)dt\right|^2.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Starting from Eq$.$ \eqref{E:ave_T_w1} and following the derivation in
Appendix \ref{Appendix_A}, one arrives at the expression for the SED 
of a single phonon mode,
\begin{equation}\label{E:Lorentzian_NMD_2}
\begin{split}
T\kvw = \frac{C_0\kv}{2}\frac{\Gamma\kv/\pi}
{[\omega_0\kv-\omega]^2+\Gamma^2\kv},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
which is a Lorentzian function with center at $\omega_0\kv$ and a 
half-width at half-maximum (linewidth) of
$\Gamma\kv$. The constant $C_0\kv$ is defined in Eq$.$ \eqref{A:E:C_0} in 
Appendix \ref{Appendix_A}. We know from anharmonic lattice dynamics theory 
that the phonon linewidth is related to the phonon lifetime, $\tau\kv$, 
by\cite{maradudin_scattering_1962,ladd_lattice_1986}
\begin{equation}\label{E:lifetime}
\begin{split}
\tau\kv=&\frac{1}{2\Gamma\kv}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The MD simulations we perform here are classical. For a classical system 
in the harmonic limit (i.e., temperature approaching zero) there is an 
equipartition of energy and $\sum_{\nu}^{3n} T\kvw = \sum_{\nu}^{3n} 
V\kvw$.\cite{mcquarrie_statistical_2000} 
In an anharmonic system (i.e., a MD 
simulation), the assumption of equipartition of energy can be tested 
by predicting the system-level specific heat (see Section 
\ref{Subsection_Comp_Details_3}). By assuming equipartition of energy, 
the phonon SED at a particular wavevector is
\begin{equation}\label{E:Lorentzian_NMD}
\begin{split}
\Phi(\pmb{\kappa},\omega) = 2\sum_{\nu}^{3n} T\kvw =& \sum_{\nu}^{3n}
C_0\kv\frac{\Gamma\kv/\pi}{[\omega_0\kv-\omega]^2+\Gamma^2\kv},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
which is a superposition of $3n$ Lorentzian functions with centers at 
$\omega_0\kv$ (one for each polarization). For simplicity, we refer to 
$\Phi(\pmb{\kappa},\omega)$ as $\Phi$. Given a set of atomic velocities,
$\Phi$ can be calculated using Eq$.$ \eqref{E:qdot_HLD} and 
\eqref{E:ave_T_w1}, and then fit using Eq$.$ \eqref{E:Lorentzian_NMD} 
to extract the phonon properties $\omega_0\kv$ and $\tau\kv$.

Previous work using normal mode analysis has represented the phonon 
energy in the time domain,
\cite{ladd_lattice_1986,mcgaughey_quantitative_2004,
henry_spectral_2008,
turney_predicting_2009,goicochea_thermal_2010,he_thermal_2011} 
while $\Phi$ is a representation 
of the phonon energy in the frequency domain. The time- and 
frequency-domain approaches are mathematically equivalent by use 
of the Wiener-Khinchin theorem.
\cite{rudin_real_1987,shiomi_thermal_2011} The 
frequency-domain approach has the advantage of predicting both the 
phonon lifetime and frequency by fitting a simpler function than 
required in the time-domain approach.












(WORK)











We start from Eq$.$ \eqref{E:qdot_HLD} and follow the formulation of 
anharmonic lattice dynamics theory.
\cite{maradudin_dynamical_1974,wallace_thermodynamics_1972,
dove_introduction_1993,srivastava_physics_1990} In an 
anharmonic system, the phonon populations fluctuate about the
equilibrium distribution function.\cite{wallace_thermodynamics_1972} 
The phonon mode 
coordinate for the mode described by ($\pmb{\kappa},\nu$) and its time
derivative can be written as
\begin{equation}\label{A:E:q_A}
\begin{split}
q\kvt=&q_{SS}\kvt+q_{T}\kvt
\end{split}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{A:E:qdot_A}
\begin{split}
\dot{q}\kvt=& \dot{q}_{SS}\kvt+\dot{q}_{T}\kvt.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The steady-state ($SS$) and transient ($T$) parts and their time 
derivatives are given by
\begin{equation}\label{A:E:q_A_SS}
\begin{split}
q_{SS}\kvt=& C_1\kv\exp[i\omega_0\kv t]
\\& +C_2\kv\exp[-i\omega_0\kv t],
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{A:E:q_A_T}
\begin{split}
q_{T}\kvt=& \EXP{-\Gamma\kv |t|}\lbrace C_3\kv\EXP{i\omega_0\kv t}
\\ &-C_4\kv\EXP{-i\omega_0\kv t } \rbrace,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{A:E:qdot_A_SS}
\begin{split}
\dot{q}_{SS}\kvt=& i\omega_0\left\{C_1\kv\exp[i\omega_0\kv t]-C_2\kv
\exp[-i\omega_0\kv t]\right\} ,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{E:qdot_A_T}
\begin{split}
\dot{q}_{T}\kvt=& \EXP{-\Gamma\kv |t|}\left\{C_3\kv
\left[i\omega_0\kv-\Gamma\kv\right]\EXP{i\omega_0\kv t}\right. \\
& \left.-C_4\kv\left[i\omega_0\kv+\Gamma\kv\right]\EXP{-i\omega_0\kv t}\;
\right\},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where the $C$s are constants and $\omega_0\kv$ and $\Gamma\kv$ are the 
phonon
mode frequency and linewidth.  The transient part
describes the creation of an excess in the population of a phonon mode 
for
$t<0$ and its decay back to equilibrium for $t>0$.

Phonon population fluctuations are commonly modeled using the excitation 
and decay of
a single phonon mode (i.e., the single mode relaxation time approximation).
In a real system, there will be multiple phonons in
each mode that simultaneously grow or decay with time.  Thus, dealing 
only
with $\dot{q}$, we let
\begin{equation}\label{A:E:qdot_A_kvbat}
\begin{split}
\dot{q}\kvt =& \sum_j i\EXP{-\Gamma\kv |t-t_j|}\times \\
& \lbrace A_j\kv\left[\omega_0\kv+i\Gamma\kv\right]
\EXP{i\omega_0\kv (t-t_j)} \\
& -B_j\kv \left[\omega_0\kv-i\Gamma\kv\right]\EXP{-i\omega_0\kv (t-t_j) }
\; \rbrace,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where many phonons in each mode, indexed by $j$, are simultaneously 
being
created and destroyed.  The phonons grow for $t<t_j$, decay for $t>t_j$,
and $A_j$ and $B_j$ are constants.  We are  not concerned with the 
values of
$t_j$, $A_j$, and $B_j$, though they should satisfy the long-time average
$\langle\dot{q}^*\kvt\dot{q}\kvt\rangle = \langle\dot{q}_{SS}^*\kvt
\dot{q}_{SS}\kvt\rangle$.

The expectation value of the kinetic energy of the normal mode in the time 
domain is
\begin{equation}\label{A:E:ave_T_t}
\begin{split}
\langle T\kv \rangle=&\frac{1}{2}\lim_{\tau_0\rightarrow\infty}
\frac{1}{\tau_0}\int_{0}^{\tau_0}\dot{q}^*\kvt\dot{q}\kvt dt.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The expectation value of the kinetic energy of the normal mode can 
be transformed from the time domain to the
frequency domain by Parseval's theorem,\cite{rudin_real_1987} giving
\begin{equation}\label{A:E:ave_T_w1}
\begin{split}
T\kvw=&\lim_{\tau_0\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{2\tau_0}
\left|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{0}^{\tau_0}\dot{q}\kvt
\exp(-i\omega t)dt\right|^2.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
By substituting Eq$.$ \eqref{A:E:qdot_A_kvbat} into Eq$.$ 
\eqref{A:E:ave_T_w1} and performing the time integration we find
\begin{equation}\label{A:E:ave_T_w_int}
\begin{split}
T\kvw = \frac{1}{16\pi\tau_0}\left|\sum_j\EXP{-i\omega t_j} 
\left\{A_j\kv\frac{\omega_0\kv+i\Gamma\kv}{\omega_0\kv-\omega+i\Gamma\kv}
\right.\right.\\
\left.\left.+B_j\kv\frac{\omega_0\kv-i\Gamma\kv}
{\omega_0\kv+\omega-i\Gamma\kv}\right\}\right|^2.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We are primarily interested in values of $\omega$ where 
$\omega\approx\omega_0$ when $\Gamma<<\omega_0$ (this condition is 
met for the three systems studied here).  When $\omega\approx\omega_0$, 
the term involving $A_j$ becomes large and the term involving $B_j$ can 
be neglected (alternatively, we could ignore the term involving $A_j$ 
when $\omega\approx-\omega_0$).  Hence, we find
\begin{equation}\label{A:E:ave_T_w_approx}
\begin{split}
T\kvw=\frac{1}{16\pi\tau_0}\sum_j\sum_{j'}\cos\left[\omega (t_{j'}-t_j)
\right]A_j\kv A_{j'}\kv\\
\times\frac{\omega_0^2\kv+\Gamma^2\kv}{\Gamma\kv}\frac{\Gamma\kv}
{[\omega_0\kv-\omega]^2+\Gamma^2\kv}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We arrive at the expression for the phonon spectral energy density for the 
wavevector $\pmb{\kappa}$ by summing Eq$.$ \eqref{A:E:ave_T_w_approx} 
over the different polarizations $\nu$,
\begin{equation}\label{A:E:Lorentzian_NMD}
\begin{split}
\Phi(\pmb{\kappa},\omega) = 2\sum_{\nu}^{3n} T\kvw=\sum_{\nu}^{3n}C_0\kv
\frac{\Gamma\kv/\pi}{[\omega_0\kv-\omega]^2+\Gamma^2\kv},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where the factor of two comes from equipartition of kinetic and potential 
energy (valid for a harmonic classical system, see Section 
\ref{Subsection_Comp_Details_3}), and
\begin{equation}\label{A:E:C_0}
\begin{split}
C_0\kv = \sum_j\sum_{j'}\cos\left[\omega (t_{j'}-t_j)\right]A_j\kv A_{j'}
\kv\frac{\omega_0^2\kv+\Gamma^2\kv}{8\tau_0\Gamma\kv}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Thus, the phonon spectral energy density $\Phi(\pmb{\kappa},\omega)$ is 
a superposition of $3n$ Lorentzian
functions with centers at $\omega_0\kv$ (one for each polarization) with 
a linewidth (half-width at half-maximum) of
$\Gamma\kv$. $\Phi$ is a spectral energy density since its integral over 
all wavevectors and frequencies is the total crystal energy, i.e., the Hamiltonian is
\begin{equation}\label{A:E:equipartition}
\begin{split}
H=\int\limits_{V_{BZ}} \int_{0}^{\infty}\Phi(\pmb{\kappa},\omega)d\omega 
d\pmb{\kappa},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $V_{BZ}$ is the volume of the first Brillouin zone.  Like the 
frequency broadening, there is also a broadening of the SED in wavevector.
\cite{turneythesis} For a finite sampling of the first Brillouin zone, 
the Hamiltonian can be approximated by
\begin{equation}\label{A:E:equipartition}
\begin{split}
H \approx 2\sum_{\pmb{\kappa},\nu}^{N,3n}\langle T\kvt\rangle = 
\sum_{\pmb{\kappa}}^N \int_{0}^{\infty}\Phi(\omega,\pmb{\kappa})d\omega.
\end{split}
\end{equation}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\label{S:Subsection_Proposed_SED}Alternative Formulation, 
$\Phi'$}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
We now seek to motivate the 
expression $\Phi'$ that was proposed in previous studies but has not 
been validated 
\cite{maruyama_molecular_2003,shiomi_non-fourier_2006,
thomas_predicting_2010}. Thomas et al. 
\cite{thomas_predicting_2010} define
\begin{equation}\label{Lorentzian_SED}
\begin{split}
\Phi'(\pmb{\kappa},\omega) =& \frac{1}{4\pi\tau_0} \sum_\alpha^3 
\sum_b^n \frac{m_b}{N}
\left| \sum_l^N  \int_{0}^{\tau_0} \dot{u}_{\alpha}\lbt \EXP{\Theta} dt 
\right|^2,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\Theta \equiv i[\pmb{\kappa}\cdot\mathbf{r}_0\ab{l}{0}-\omega t]$. 
To understand this expression, we start with the real-space atomic 
velocities as 
represented by the normal mode velocities, $\dot{q}\kpvt$ 
\cite{dove_introduction_1993},
\begin{equation}\label{E:udot_HLD}
\begin{split}
\dot{u}_{\alpha}\lbt = &\SUMprime{2}{} \frac{1}{\sqrt{m_bN}} 
\EXP{i\pmb{\kappa}^{'}\cdot\mathbf{r}_0\ab{l}{0}} e^*\kpvba 
\dot{q}\kpvt{}{}{}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Fourier transforming both sides of Equation \eqref{E:udot_HLD} in time 
and space, taking the complex modulus, and summing over the atoms in 
the unit cell 
and the Cartesian directions yields
\begin{multline}\label{SED}
\lim_{\tau_0\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{4\pi\tau_0} \sum_\alpha^3 
\sum_b^n \frac{m_b}{N} 
\left\lvert \sum_l^N  \int_{0}^{\tau_0} \dot{u}_{\alpha}\lbt 
\EXP{\Theta} dt \right\rvert^2 =
\\ \lim_{\tau_0\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{4\pi\tau_0} \sum_\alpha^3 
\sum_b^n 
\left\lvert \frac{m_b^{3/2}}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_l^N \sum_{\nu}^{3n} e^*\kvba 
\int_{0}^{\tau_0}\dot{q}\kvt\EXP{\Theta}dt \right\rvert^2 ,
\end{multline}
where the the sum over $\pmb{\kappa}^{'}$ on the right-hand-side is 
reduced to a 
single wavevector by the orthogonality of the allowed wavevectors over 
the periodic 
domain. Equation \eqref{Lorentzian_SED} is the finite integration of the 
left-hand-side of Equation \eqref{SED}. For simplicity, we refer to 
$\Phi'(\pmb{\kappa},\omega)$ 
as $\Phi'$. Given a set of atomic velocities, Thomas et al. extract the 
phonon properties 
$\omega_0\kv$ and $\tau\kv$ from Equation \eqref{Lorentzian_SED} by 
fitting $\Phi'$ for a 
given wavevector to a superposition of Lorentzian functions.

Thomas et al. \cite{thomas_predicting_2010} claim that $\Phi'$ 
represents the phonon SED. As seen in 
Equation \eqref{E:udot_HLD}, the phonon mode eigenvectors are necessary 
to properly map
 between the atomic velocities and the normal mode coordinates. This need 
 for the eigenvectors 
is the essential difference between the expressions for $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$. 
The potential 
advantage of $\Phi'$ is that other than the wavevectors, which can be 
determined from the 
crystal structure, no phonon properties need to be known {\em a priori}. 
However, to identify 
the degenerate modes in $\Phi'$, the phonon frequencies are necessary 
(see Section 
\ref{Subsection_Comp_Details_2}). Since $\Phi'$ does not require the phonon 
mode eigenvector, 
it can (in principle) be used to study disordered systems or perturbed 
crystalline systems 
(e.g. dilute alloys \cite{shiomi_thermal_2011}, water-filled CNTs 
\cite{thomas_predicting_2010}, and CNTs on 
substrates \cite{ong_reduction_2011}). Despite its use in previous studies, 
$\Phi'$ has not been 
rigorously validated.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{\label{Appendix_B}Interpretation of $\Phi'$}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
(WORK): combine disucssion is book and also on static and 
dynamic-structure factor.  
SF can be related to the DOS(cite).  

As demonstrated in Section \ref{S:Subsection_prop_LJ}, $\Phi'$ is not 
the phonon spectral energy density, $\Phi$, defined by Eq$.$ 
\eqref{E:ave_T_w1}. Our findings and those of others,
\cite{maruyama_molecular_2003,dekoker_thermal_2009,
thomas_predicting_2010,qiu_molecular_2011,shiomi_thermal_2011} 
however, suggest that $\Phi'$ does contain accurate information about 
the phonon frequencies.  Under the harmonic approximation, the phonons 
are non-interacting and have no transient response beyond a harmonic 
oscillation (see Appendix \ref{Appendix_A} Eq$.$ \eqref{A:E:qdot_A} 
and \eqref{E:qdot_A_T}),
\begin{equation}\label{E:qdot_A_SS}
\begin{split}
\dot{q}\kvt =& \dot{q}_{SS}\kvt  \\
=& i\omega_0\kv\left\{C_1\kv\exp[i\omega_0\kv t]-C_2\kv
\exp[-i\omega_0\kv t]\right\}.
 \end{split}
\end{equation}
Inserting Eq$.$ \eqref{E:qdot_A_SS} into the right hand side of Eq$.$ 
\eqref{SED} gives
\begin{equation}\label{Delta_SED}
\begin{split}
\sum_\alpha^3 \sum_b^n m_b \left| \sum_l^N  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} 
\dot{u}_{\alpha}\lbt \EXP{i\pmb{\kappa}\cdot
\mathbf{r}_0\ab{l}{0}-i\omega t} 
dt \right|^2 =& \\
\sum_\alpha^3 \sum_b^n\left| \frac{m_b^{3/2}}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_l^N 
\sum_{\nu}^{3n}  D\kvba \EXP{i\pmb{\kappa}\cdot\mathbf{r}_0\ab{l}{0}} 
\delta[ \omega_0\kv - \omega] \right|^2 ,
 \end{split}
\end{equation}
where $D\kvba = i\sqrt{2\pi} \omega_0\kv C_1\kv e^*\kvba$, $\delta$ is 
the Dirac function, and values of $\omega \le 0$ are ignored. Thus, at 
zero temperature Eq$.$ \eqref{Lorentzian_SED} is a superposition of Dirac 
functions at the phonon frequencies $\omega_0\kv$.

\section{\label{A:NMD XCORR}
NMD using Non-Exact Normal Modes}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a normal mode of the lattice supercell 
used for the MD simulations (i.e., a Gamma mode), 
the total energy autocorrelation is an exponential function  
with a decay time $\tau\kv$ and the kinetic energy autocorrelation is a 
exponentially-damped sinusoidal oscillation with frequency 
$2\omega\kv$.\cite{mcgaughey_predicting_2013} 
When projecting MD simulations  
of the explicitly disordered lattice supercells 
onto the VC normal modes, 
the energy autocorrelation functions 
do not always follow these simple functional forms, 
as shown in Fig. \ref{F:NMD XCORR} for two modes in the LJ alloy at a 
concentration of 0.5.  
By calculating the mode kinetic energy in the  
frequency-domain, $\Phi$,\cite{larkin_comparison_2012} artifacts such as 
multiple peaks are observed (see main plot).   

These artifacts are not surprising given two considerations: 
(i) the MD simulations 
contain explicit disorder that influences the atomic trajectories, 
and (ii) the VC-normal modes are not the exact normal modes of the 
explicitly-disordered lattice supercells. 
An effective lifetime can be predicted 
using Eq. \eqref{EQ:tau_nmd} 
because the VC total mode energy autocorrelations 
still decay to zero in a finite time. This result is to be expected 
given that the atomic trajectories contain 
information about the lattice energy, which from general statistical 
physics principles will have exponential relaxation behavior in an 
equilibrium ensemble.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\label{Subsection_Comp_Details_1}Allowed Wavevectors}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now that we have presented the two expressions for the phonon SED, we will 
provide the computational details of how they can be evaluated and used 
to predict 
phonon properties. The SED is defined for the allowed wavevectors of a 
crystal, which can 
be specified from the crystal structure's Bravais lattice, its basis (i.e., 
unit cell), and 
the size of the computational domain. A $D$-dimensional Bravais lattice 
is a collection of 
points with
positions
\begin{equation}\label{crys_pos}
\begin{split}
\mathbf{r}_0\ab{l}{0} =& \sum^D_{\alpha} N_{\alpha}\mathbf{a}_{\alpha},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{a}_{\alpha}$ are the lattice vectors and $N_{\alpha}$ is 
an integer 
\cite{dove_introduction_1993}. The unit cell is the building block of 
the crystal and is placed on the 
points defined by the Bravais lattice. The equilibrium position of any 
atom in the crystal 
can be described by
\begin{equation}\label{crys_pos2}
\begin{split}
\mathbf{r}_0\ab{l}{b} = \mathbf{r}_0\ab{l}{0} + \mathbf{r}_0\ab{0}{b},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{r}_0\ab{0}{b}$ is the equilibrium position of the 
$b^{\textrm{th}}$ atom in 
the unit cell relative to $\mathbf{r}_0\ab{l}{0}$. The allowed wavevectors 
for any crystal 
structure are defined by
\begin{equation}\label{crys_pos3}
\begin{split}
\pmb{\kappa} = \sum_{\alpha} \mathbf{b}_{\alpha} 
\frac{n_{\alpha}}{N_{\alpha}},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{b}_{\alpha}$ are the reciprocal lattice vectors and 
$-N_{\alpha}/2 < 
n_{\alpha} \leq N_{\alpha}/2$, where $n_{\alpha}$ are integers and 
$N_{\alpha}$ are now 
constant even integers. The wavevectors are taken to be in the first 
Brillouin zone 
\cite{ashcroft_solid_1976}.

For the LJ argon and SW silicon systems studied here, the cubic 
conventional cells are 
used with four (argon) and eight (silicon) atoms per unit cell. For the 
MD simulations of
 LJ argon and SW silicon, cubic simulation domains are used (i.e., 
 $N_1 = N_2 = N_3 = N_0$) 
\cite{mcgaughey_quantitative_2004,turney_predicting_2009,
sellan_size_2010}. For the CNT, the Brillouin 
zone is one-dimensional, 
so that $N_1 = N_2 = 1$, and we take $N_3=50$ 
\cite{thomas_predicting_2010}.

\subsection{\label{Subsection_Comp_Details_2}Phonon Lifetimes and 
Frequencies}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once the allowed wavevectors are specified, the atomic velocities from 
an MD simulation can 
be used to calculate $\Phi'$ using Equation \eqref{Lorentzian_SED}. To 
calculate $\Phi$ 
[Equation \eqref{E:Lorentzian_NMD}], (WORK) 
require the phonon mode eigenvector, which can be obtained using harmonic 
lattice dynamics calculations 
and the finite temperature lattice constant (i.e., quasi-harmonic lattice 
dynamics calculations) 
\cite{dove_introduction_1993}. The $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ methods can used 
for any material system where there are 
available interatomic potentials.

The phonon frequencies and lifetimes are found by fitting the spectral 
curves $\Phi$ and 
$\Phi'$ with Lorentzian functions using a non-linear least squares method. 
Both of these 
phonon properties are independent of the Lorentzian peak magnitude. For 
$\Phi'$, the different 
polarizations at a given wavevector are superimposed by definition of 
Equation \eqref{Lorentzian_SED}. 
The different polarizations can be fit individually using single Lorentzian 
peaks or as a 
superposition of peaks. At high temperatures, the broadening of the peaks 
from different 
polarizations can make it difficult to uniquely locate the peaks in 
$\Phi'$. Knowledge of the 
quasi-harmonic frequencies is necessary to identify the unique peaks in 
$\Phi'$ as well as 
degeneracies \cite{mcgaughey_phonon_2006,turney_predicting_2009}.

$\Phi$ has the advantage that degenerate and nearly degenerate 
polarizations can be 
isolated and fit individually. The uncertainty in the predicted phonon 
frequencies is 
on the order of the frequency resolution used to perform the fast Fourier 
transforms 
required to evaluate $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$, which is $10^2-10^4$ less than 
the phonon frequencies 
studied in this work (see Sections \ref{S:Subsection_prop_LJ}, 
\ref{S:Subsection_prop_SW}, 
and \ref{S:Subsection_prop_CNT}). At the temperatures studied in this work, 
we find that 
fitting single or simultaneous peaks in either $\Phi$ or $\Phi'$ results 
in less than five 
percent difference in the predicted lifetimes. The uncertainty from 
fitting the Lorentzian 
functions is between five and ten percent of the predicted lifetimes, 
with the error increasing 
with increasing temperature.\footnote[1]{The range of data must be selected 
when fitting the 
Lorentzian functions to $\Phi$ or $\Phi'$. This range should be large 
enough for the Lorentzian 
functions to decrease significantly from their value at
half-width at half-maximum, where the linewidth is specified, but not 
too large as to pick up 
noise. The error in predicting the lifetime is obtained by varying the 
range of data
used to fit the Lorentzian function.}

To illustrate the procedure, $\Phi$ was calculated for LJ argon (Section 
\ref{S:Subsection_prop_LJ}) with $N_0=8$ and $T=20$ K, where $T$ is 
temperature. 
$\Phi$ for the three modes of lowest frequency and wavevector 
$[\pi/4a,\pi/4a,\pi/4a]$ 
is shown in Fig$.$ \ref{F:LJ_FIT_PEAK}. The lower-frequency peak 
corresponds to the two 
degenerate transverse acoustic modes, while the higher frequency peak 
corresponds to the 
longitudinal acoustic mode \cite{dove_introduction_1993}.

\subsection{\label{Subsection_Comp_Details_3}Thermal Conductivity}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once the frequencies and lifetimes of all phonon modes in the first
Brillouin zone are obtained, the bulk thermal conductivity in direction
$\mathbf{n}$, $k_{\mathbf{n}}$, can be calculated from 
\cite{ziman_electrons_2001}
\begin{equation}\label{E-size:k_bulk}\
\begin{split}
k_{\mathbf{n}}=&\sum_{\pmb{\kappa}} \sum_\nu c_{ph} \kv 
v^{2}_{g,\mathbf{n}} \kv \tau \kv.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Here, $c_{ph}$ is the phonon volumetric specific heat and 
${v}_{g,\mathbf{n}}$ is
the component of the group velocity vector in direction $\mathbf{n}$. 
Since the systems 
we consider are classical and obey Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics 
\cite{mcquarrie_statistical_2000}, the
specific heat is $k_{\mathrm{B}}$ per mode in the harmonic limit, where 
$k_{\mathrm{B}}$ 
is the Boltzmann constant. As temperature increases, anharmonicity causes 
the mode specific 
heats to deviate from $k_{\mathrm{B}}$ \cite{mcgaughey_quantitative_2004}. 
The effect is small for the 
systems and temperatures studied here. For LJ argon, the mode-averaged 
specific heat has 
been predicted to be $0.95k_{\mathrm{B}}$ per mode at a temperature of 
$40$ K and approaches 
$k_{\mathrm{B}}$ with decreasing temperature 
\cite{mcgaughey_quantitative_2004}. For SW silicon at a 
temperature of $300$ K, the predicted mode-averaged specific heat is 
$1.01k_{\mathrm{B}}$ 
per mode \cite{goicochea_thermal_2010}. For the CNT at $T=300$ K, we 
predict the mode-averaged 
specific heat to be $1.03k_{\mathrm{B}}$ per mode. Because we do not have 
mode-dependent 
specific heats, we take the specific heat to be $k_{\mathrm{B}}$ per mode 
for the three 
systems studied (argon, silicon, and CNT).  The group velocity vector is 
the gradient of 
the dispersion curve (i.e., $\partial \omega / \partial \pmb{\kappa}$) and 
can be calculated 
from the frequencies and wavevectors using finite differences. In this 
work, the group 
velocities are calculated using the frequencies from quasi-harmonic 
lattice dynamics 
calculations because a smaller finite difference in wavevector can be used 
than what is 
available from the MD simulations (see Section 
\ref{Subsection_Comp_Details_1}).
\footnote[2]{The anharmonic frequency shift affects the group velocity. 
McGaughey and Kaviany find that anharmonic and quasi-harmonic predictions 
of 
the group velocity differ for LJ Argon by less than one percent at a 
temperature of 
$50$ K and that the difference decreases with decreasing temperature 
\cite{mcgaughey_quantitative_2004}. 
The anharmonic frequency shifts are on average a few percent for LJ argon 
at a temperature 
of $40$ K and are less for the other temperatures and systems studied here.}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{\label{Appendix_C}Finite Simulation-Size Scaling for Thermal 
Conductivity}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
(WORK): add discussion from vc and mfp papers. 

For the LJ argon system studied in Section \ref{S:Subsection_prop_LJ}, a 
finite simulation-size scaling procedure
\cite{turney_predicting_2009,he_thermal_2011} is used 
to compare the thermal conductivity predictions from $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ to 
those from the Green-Kubo method. The scaling procedure is demonstrated in 
Fig$.$ \ref{F:LJ_COND}.  The thermal conductivity is predicted from $\Phi$ 
or $\Phi'$ and MD simulations with $N_0 = 4,6,8,$ and $10$. The bulk 
conductivity, $k_{\infty}$, is then estimated by fitting the data to
\begin{equation}\label{k_size}
\begin{split}
1/k = 1/k_{\infty} + A/N_0,
 \end{split}
\end{equation}
where $A$ is a constant. This procedure is necessary because the first 
Brillouin zone is only sampled at a finite number of points for a finite 
simulation size, with no contribution from the volume at its center. To 
predict a bulk thermal conductivity, it is important to sample points 
near the Brillouin zone center, where the modes can have large lifetimes 
and group velocities.\cite{turney_predicting_2009,sellan_size_2010} 
As with the 
extrapolated bulk thermal conductivities at temperatures of $5$ and 
$20$ K (see Table \ref{T:cond_table}), the predicted thermal 
conductivities at each system size ($N_0=4,6,8,$ and $10$) are 
systematically smaller and outside the prediction uncertainties for 
$\Phi'$ compared to $\Phi$.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

is used to compare the results to bulk predictions made using the 
Green-Kubo method. (b) The bulk results for $\Phi$ and Green-Kubo are 
in good agreement temperatures of $20$ and $40$ K with those of other 
atomistic simulation methods,\cite{turney_predicting_2009} while those 
from $\Phi'$ differ (see Table \ref{T:cond_table}).}
\end{figure}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------


%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\label{Subsection_Comp_Details_4}Computational Cost}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The computational cost of evaluating Equation \eqref{Lorentzian_SED} is 
less than that for 
Equation \eqref{E:Lorentzian_NMD} by a factor of $3b$, where $b$ is the 
number of atoms in the 
unit cell.  For bulk crystals, the number of atoms in the unit cell is 
typically small 
($b<10$).  For the (8,8) CNT system, $b=32$ and evaluating $\Phi'$ is 
two orders of magnitude 
less expensive than evaluating $\Phi$.

To calculate the phonon lifetimes, the MD simulation time should be an 
order of magnitude 
longer than the longest phonon lifetime \cite{thomas_water_2010}.  
If only the 
phonon frequencies 
are required, however, the location of the peaks in $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ 
develop in a time on 
the order of the inverse of the phonon frequency, $1/\omega_0\kv$. For the 
systems studied 
here, this time can be two to five orders of magnitude less than the time 
needed to develop 
the lifetimes.

Fitting $\Phi'$ becomes challenging at higher temperatures, when the 
phonon linewidths 
broaden and become comparable to the spacing between mode frequencies. 
The cost of 
fitting $\Phi'$ can be reduced by fitting the peaks from all allowed 
wavevectors in the 
system simultaneously, but the error associated with this procedure is 
unknown 
\cite{shiomi_thermal_2011}. We find that a semi-automated procedure, 
whereby the fits are 
visualized, is necessary to ensure that all peaks are fit correctly.  
While the 
computational cost of fitting $\Phi'$ is much smaller than the 
computational cost of 
calculating $\Phi'$, the semi-automated fitting procedure can be of 
similar time cost 
to the user. The cost of fitting $\Phi$ is much smaller because the 
different polarization 
peaks can be isolated and the fitting can be fully automated.

\section{\label{S:Section_Prop}Case Studies}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{\label{S:Subsection_prop_LJ}Lennard-Jones Argon}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
We now use MD simulation to compare the SED, phonon properties, and 
thermal conductivity 
calculated for LJ argon using $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$. The MD simulations are 
performed using 
LAMMPS \cite{LAMMPS}. A truncated and shifted
potential cutoff scheme is used with a cutoff radius of 8.5 $\AA$. The 
quasi-harmonic 
phonon frequencies, eigenvectors, and group velocities are generated 
using GULP \cite{GULP}.
 We consider temperatures of 5, 20, and 40 K at zero-pressure with lattice 
 constants of 
5.278, 5.315, and 5.371 $\AA$. For LJ argon, Turney et al. found that 
lattice dynamics-based 
predictions of thermal conductivity (e.g., by anharmonic lattice dynamics 
or $\Phi$) start to 
diverge from MD-based predictions (e.g., from the direct or Green-Kubo 
methods) above half the 
melting temperature ($T_{\mathrm{melt}} \approx 80$ K) 
\cite{turney_predicting_2009}. Here, we limit the 
temperature to below half the melting temperature for the three systems 
studied (argon, 
silicon, and CNT).

The MD system consists of $N_1 \times N_2 \times N_3 = 8^3 = 512$ 
conventional cubic unit 
cells for a total of 2048 atoms ($b=4$ atoms). Using a 4.285 fs time step, 
the system is 
equilibrated for $2^{20}$ time steps before collecting data every $2^5$ 
time steps for an 
additional $2^{20}$ time steps in the $NVE$ ensemble (constant number of 
atoms, system volume, 
and total system energy) \cite{mcquarrie_statistical_2000}. 
The sampling rate must be high enough to capture 
the highest phonon frequency in the system. The sampling rate and total 
run time are chosen in 
powers of two as a convenience in performing the fast Fourier transforms 
required to efficiently 
evaluate $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$. The same MD simulation data are used to 
calculate $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$.  
Five simulations with different initial conditions are performed and the 
$\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ 
values are averaged before the peak fitting. $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ are further 
averaged over 
degenerate wavevectors in the Brillouin zone, reducing the wavevectors to 
the first octant 
\cite{mcgaughey_phonon_2004}.

The SED ($\Phi$ and $\Phi'$) for the wavevector [$\pi/2a$,0,0] is presented 
in Fig$.$ 
\ref{F:PEAK_COMPARE} for all three temperatures (the edge of the Brillouin 
zone is at 
[$\pi/a$,0,0]).  For $\Phi$, the spectral curve is plotted as a 
superposition over the 
twelve phonon polarizations, with degeneracy reducing the number of peaks 
to seven.  Overall, 
$\Phi'$ does not equal the total phonon spectral energy density $\Phi$, 
but the major features 
are similar. At all temperatures there are linewdith variations between 
the two spectral curves. 
The peak magnitudes become comparable for $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ as the 
temperature increases.

that peak broadening at higher temperatures and frequencies above $10$ 
rads/ps can force peaks

$\Phi$ does not suffer 
from this issue since the broadened peaks can be fit individually.}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The phonon frequencies and lifetimes extracted for all allowed wavevectors 
in the first Brillouin 
zone using $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ at each of the three temperatures are 
compared on a mode-by-mode 
basis in Figs$.$ \ref{F:FREQ_LIFE_LJ}(a), \ref{F:FREQ_LIFE_LJ}(b), and 
\ref{F:FREQ_LIFE_LJ}(c). 
There, $\omega_0$, $\omega_0^{'}$, $\tau$, and $\tau^{'}$  refer to the 
mode properties predicted 
using $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$. The phonon frequencies agree well at all three 
temperatures, with 
increasing scatter at high temperatures and high frequencies.  This scatter 
is due to the high-frequency 
peak broadening seen in Fig$.$ \ref{F:PEAK_COMPARE} at $T = 40$ K, which 
can force peaks close in 
frequency for $\Phi'$ to be fit as a single Lorentzian function. The 
frequencies predicted by $\Phi$ 
and $\Phi'$ include the effects of anharmonicity, which increase the 
frequencies compared to the quasi-harmonic predictions 
\cite{mcgaughey_phonon_2006,turney_predicting_2009}. The agreement 
between the frequencies 
predicted from $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ is explained in 
(REF) (WORK).

The lifetimes show large scatter between $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ on a 
mode-by-mode basis, with increasing 
scatter at high temperature that shows no systematic difference. The 
scatter at high frequencies 
is in part due to the peak broadening seen in Fig$.$ \ref{F:PEAK_COMPARE}, 
which can force peaks 
close in frequency for $\Phi'$ to be fit as a single Lorentzian function 
with a single lifetime. 
The broadening does not affect fitting at low frequencies, where the 
linewidths are much smaller 
than the peak spacings. There, any scatter comes solely from the difference 
between $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$.

The phonon properties are then used to predict thermal conductivity using 
Equation 
\eqref{E-size:k_bulk}. The results are presented in Table 
\ref{T:cond_table}. The bulk thermal 
conductivities provided in Table \ref{T:cond_table} are predicted using 
the finite simulation-size 
scaling procedure discussed in \cite{turney_predicting_2009}. The bulk 
thermal conductivities predicted from 
$\Phi'$ are smaller and outside the uncertainty for those predicted from 
$\Phi$ for temperatures of 
$5$ and $20$ K. While the bulk thermal conductivities at a temperature of 
$40$ K agree within their 
uncertainties, the predicted mode-by-mode lifetimes show large scatter 
[Fig$.$ \ref{F:FREQ_LIFE_LJ}(c)] 
and the agreement should be regarded as coincidental.

The disagreement between $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ in thermal conductivity comes 
directly from the differences 
in the phonon lifetimes. All other properties (frequencies, group 
velocities, specific heats) are 
nearly or exactly the same for the two calculations. The bulk thermal 
conductivities predicted from 
$\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ are also compared to predictions from the Green-Kubo 
method\cite{mcquarrie_statistical_2000} in 
Table \ref{T:cond_table}. For $N_1=N_2=N_3=8$, the thermal conductivity 
predicted by the Green-Kubo 
method is converged with respect to the simulation size 
\cite{mcgaughey_quantitative_2004}. The same MD data used 
to calculate $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ is used for the Green-Kubo predictions. For 
all three temperatures, 
there is good agreement between the thermal conductivity predictions using 
$\Phi$ and Green-Kubo. For 
temperatures of $20$ and $40$ K, there is good agreement between the 
predictions from $\Phi$, Green-Kubo, 
and previous reports using non-equilibrium MD, anharmonic lattice dynamics, 
and time-domain $\Phi$ 
\cite{turney_predicting_2009}.

\subsection{\label{S:Subsection_prop_SW}Stillinger-Weber Silicon}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
We next compare the phonon properties and thermal conductivity predicted 
from $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ 
for SW silicon \cite{stillinger_computer_1985} at a temperature of 
$300$ K and zero pressure with a lattice 
constant of 5.437 $\AA$. The SW system is stiffer (larger phonon group 
velocities, frequencies, and 
lifetimes) than LJ argon and is an additional test to determine if there 
is a systematic error in 
the predictions from $\Phi'$. The MD simulations are performed using 
LAMMPS \cite{plimpton_fast_1995}. The MD 
system consists
of $N_1 \times N_2 \times N_3 = 6^3 = 216$ conventional unit cells for a 
total of 1728 atoms 
($b=8$ atoms). The phonon frequencies, eigenvectors, and group velocities 
are generated using 
GULP \cite{gale_general_2003}.

Using a 0.5 fs timestep, the system is equilibrated for $2^{20}$ time 
steps before collecting 
data every $2^5$ time step for $2^{22}$ time steps in the $NVE$ ensemble 
\cite{mcquarrie_statistical_2000}. 
As with the LJ system, the sampling rate is determined by the highest 
phonon frequency in the 
system. Five simulations with different initial conditions are performed 
and the $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ 
values are averaged before the peak fitting. $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ are 
further averaged over degenerate 
wavevectors in the Brillouin zone, reducing the wavevectors to the first 
octant \cite{mcgaughey_phonon_2004}.

The extracted phonon frequencies and lifetimes are plotted in Fig$.$ 
\ref{F:FREQ_LIFE_Si}. 
As with the LJ system, the phonon frequencies are predicted accurately 
by $\Phi'$ but the 
lifetimes show large scatter on a mode-by-mode basis. For the system 
size studied, $\Phi'$ 
predicts a larger thermal conductivity than $\Phi$ outside the prediction 
uncertainties, in 
contrast to the LJ system (see Table \ref{T:cond_table}). The disagreement 
in thermal conductivity comes directly from the phonon lifetimes.

Finally, we compare the phonon properties and thermal conductivities 
predicted by $\Phi$ and 
$\Phi'$ for an (8,8) CNT (diameter of 1.10-nm and length of 12.3 nm) at 
a temperature of $300$ K 
and zero pressure \cite{thomas_predicting_2010}. 
The interactions in the CNT system 
are modeled using the 
REBO potential without the four-body interaction term 
\cite{brenner_second_2002}. 
The MD simulations are 
performed using an in-house code. The MD system consists of 1600 atoms 
(32 atoms/unit cell). The 
phonon frequencies, eigenvectors, and group velocities are generated using 
an in-house code. The 
purpose of simulating this system is to check the results of Thomas et al.
\cite{thomas_predicting_2010} (who 
used $\Phi'$ and non-equilibrium MD), and to compare the predictions of 
$\Phi'$ and $\Phi$.

Using a 1.0 fs timestep, the system is equilibrated for $2^{20}$ time 
steps before collecting data 
every $2^3$ time step for $2^{22}$ time steps in the $NVE$ ensemble 
\cite{mcquarrie_statistical_2000}. As with 
the LJ and SW systems, the sampling rate is determined by the highest 
phonon frequency in the 
system. Five simulations with different initial conditions are performed 
and the $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ 
values are averaged before the peak fitting. Since the Brillouin zone of 
the CNT is 
one-dimensional, $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ are further averaged over 
directionally-degenerate wavevectors.

The phonon frequencies and lifetimes for the allowed wavevectors in the 
one-dimensional Brillouin 
zone are shown in Fig. \ref{F:FREQ_LIFE_CNT}. Like the LJ and SW silicon 
systems, the 
phonon frequencies can be predicted accurately by $\Phi'$, but the 
lifetimes show large scatter. 
The estimated thermal conductivity of the CNT predicted using $\Phi'$ is 
in agreement with the 
results of Thomas et al. \cite{thomas_predicting_2010}. 
The thermal conductivity 
predicted by $\Phi'$ is less 
than that predicted by $\Phi$, but not outside their uncertainties.

\section{\label{Section_Conclusions}Summary}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
We presented the correct phonon SED, $\Phi$, and its relation to the phonon 
frequencies and lifetimes. 
We then presented an alternative formulation to the 
phonon spectral energy density, $\Phi'$, which does not require the phonon 
mode eigenvectors.  
Because $\Phi'$ does not contain the eigenvectors, this alternative 
formulation does not represent 
the phonon spectral energy density, but does contain information about 
the phonon dispersion as the 
temperature approaches $0$ K (see (REF) (WORK)).

We then calculated the phonon SED for LJ argon, SW silicon, and a CNT 
modeled with the REBO 
potential using $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$. The phonon frequencies and
lifetimes predicted from $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ are shown in Figs$.$ 
\ref{F:FREQ_LIFE_LJ}, 
\ref{F:FREQ_LIFE_Si} and \ref{F:FREQ_LIFE_CNT}. The
frequencies are in good agreement between the two SED methods, while the 
lifetimes show large scatter.

The phonon SED $\Phi$ is well-defined theoretically, while $\Phi'$ does 
not properly map to the 
phonon energies since it is missing the phonon mode eigenvector. We deduce 
that this is the reason 
$\Phi'$ does not accurately predict the phonon lifetimes. It is surprising 
how close the predicted 
thermal conductivities can be using $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$ (LJ at $T=40$ K and 
the CNT results). The 
thermal conductivities predicted by $\Phi$ and $\Phi'$, however, show no 
consistency for the three 
systems studied.

The most important predictions are the mode-by-mode phonon properties. Of 
particular importance are 
the lifetimes, which are the key input for Boltzmann transport 
equation-based models 
\cite{mcgaughey_size-dependent_2011}. Thus, we do not recommend $\Phi'$ 
for predicting phonon lifetimes or 
thermal conductivity.  Any agreement in thermal conductivity predictions 
between atomistic 
studies\cite{thomas_predicting_2010} and experiment
\cite{dekoker_thermal_2009,qiu_molecular_2011} should 
be regarded as 
coincidental, and the phonon lifetime reductions predicted for systems 
with additional scattering 
methods \cite{thomas_predicting_2010,shiomi_thermal_2011} should only 
be interpreted qualitatively. The use of $\Phi'$ 
in future work is discouraged and we reccomend the use of $\Phi$.
